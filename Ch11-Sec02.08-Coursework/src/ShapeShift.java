/*This program performs simple calculations and manipulations of simple 
 * shapes expressed in two-dimensional coordinate geometry.
 * 
 * First it asks the user to choose a shape, from a choice of three.
 * Then it prompts for details of the shape.
 * 		* 	A circle is specified by giving the X and then Y coordinate of its 
 *      	centre, followed by its radius. 
 * 		*	A Triangle is specified by giving the X and Y coordinates of each of
 *          its three corner points.
 *      *	A rectangle (always axis-aligned) is specified by giving the X and Y 
 *          coordinates of two of its diagonally opposite corner points.
 *          
 * Following this data, the user is prompted to specify an X offset and a Y offset.
 * 
 * The program creates the specified shape , and also a similar one, in which
 * each point has been shifted by the X and Y offsets.
 * 
 * The program then reports the following on the standard output.
 * 		*	The details of the original shape -- giving all the points
 * 			(one, three, or four) and, for a circle, its radius.
 * 		*	The area and perimeter of the shape.
 * 		*	The details of the shifted shape.
